(Person is feeling angry and wants to dwell in this emotion.)


Person: I am feeling extremely angry right now

Rbot: That must be annoying. Tell me honestly, do you want to remain angry and feel your blood boiling or do you want to solve your anger and move on?


Person: I want to remain angry, because that was unfair. 


Rbot: Alright I will let you dwell in your anger. Maybe you can come back here when you want to feel at peace.
