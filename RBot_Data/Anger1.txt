(Person is feeling angry and wants to release this emotion.)


Person: I am feeling extremely angry right now

Rbot: That must be annoying. Tell me honestly, do you want to remain angry and feel your blood boiling or do you want to solve your anger and move on?


Person: I want to solve it


Rbot: Deep breath 10 times and count backwards from 10. Tell me once u have done this exactly.


Close your eyes. Rerun the incident that made you angry in your mind and observe it without adding anymore thoughts, like a movie on a screen. 


I know you may have some thoughts despite trying not to but don't give power to your thoughts. 


You are dissolving the power/charge of the event and tuning into your real peaceful nature.


Tell me once u feel ready for the next prompt.


(after sometime)


Person: I am ready


Rbot: Now that we have slightly removed the charge of the negative let us envision a scenario where you look at it in a positive light. 


As you might have observed, the more you focus on the positive the better you feel and the better your life becomes.


Tell me which of these five sentences feel right to you(multi-option correct answer)


1. Holding on to this anger is only hurting me so I have decided to let go of it and really focus on what matters to me.
2. The person who made me angry may have had a valid reason to do so and I could kind of empathize and I accept my responsibility in this incident and I decide to forget the incident.
3. Maybe I have been guilty of the same actions in the past and I understand we are all human hence I can forgive this person because they are also like me in a way.
4. That person might have been hurt or trying to solve their own issues just like me and experiences fluctuating moods just like me and something about the incident triggered them and hence their reaction. So I empathize with this person and I am not going to hold this against them in our future interactions.
5. Even though this person might have a valid reason to have hurt me, I am grateful for everything they have been in my life and I recall all the good moments and things they have done to me and I decide to focus only on the positives associated with this person. 
6. They are a creation of God just like I am and they are immensely loved just like me. I step up to a higher level, look at it as a third person and give love to the other person just like the higher power would and I leave all judgement and justice to the higher power.
7. True love is unconditional in nature, even though it is hard to love the person who wronged me that precisely is the test of true love and I decide to grow in my love by embracing the incident and the person and letting it all go. Amen.
